			<h1>Sourdough</h1>
				<section>
					Have you called your mother lately? She's waiting on you. She is hungry, wanting to be fed regularly with an insatiable appetite for more starchy goodness to fuel her flora- the community of yeasts and bacterias that gives her character. <br>
					What's mother's nature? She rises after feeding, digesting the proteins and burping up gases which bubble and bulk up the innards. She rises slowly, creeping along and gradually turning into a thinner mother as she grows hungry. The soupier the mama, the hungrier she is.<br>
					Oops, did you neglect your mother? She wreaks of alcohol. Maybe you should skim the top of your mother and dispose of the foamy stinky slop in a feeble attempt to preserve the sour fervor for future sustenence.<br>
				</section>

				<section>
					You're one of the few that religiously care for your mother? That is beautiful. You are a bread babe and an intuitive caretaker of the fervor of culture. <br>
					How do you like to develop your mother? Do you use an autolyse, allowing your mother to feeed in a grand sceme, shortly before a salting and further hydration? <br>
					Do you keep your mother thick and dense? Adding extra chunky seeds and grain berries to absorb excess moisture? <br>
					Do you like a long fermentation? Allowing the mother to expand and evolve chemically to refine from a salting and form structure as the proteins align, stack, and weave together.<br>
					No matter how you may treat your mother, please be kind and love often by engaging with slowly chewing, tasting, and even allowing her to birth the best vehicles for spreads, cheeses, meats, and vegetables. Your mother makes the best breads. She is the leaven, the levain, the starter of sacred life and keeper of flavor and complexities. She is the reason to bake. Your mother is harsh, she will mirror the care you give her back into the quality of bread. She does not go away as the dough builds. Mother's nature is apparent in the final loaf, most especially. Do you love your loaf? Then please, love your mother and feed her regularly.<br>
					No time? Keep her in the fridge. Feed her once a week. She will be neglected, but will not die if you're lucky and occasionally check in. To be honest, all the baker babes test their luck from time to time. Mother's nature is to spark life into bread, yet our lives do not focus solely on bread itself. We need the condiments and filler between slices.

				<section>
					What does one do with a baguette?<br>
					Puddle that bread with butter<br>
					Slice the bread down the middle,<br>
					Take room temperature butter,<br>
					And make it rain on the baguette!<br>
					Puddle up, pony!<br>
					Sprinkle a salt or two<br>
					Boom boomb baguette beauty<br>
					That's how the babes bathe their breads.<br>

					You are the apple of my rye!<br>
					Rye not try something new once every now and then?<br>
					If first you don't succeed, rye rye and rye again.<br>
					Did your feelings get hurt? It's okay to rye about it!<br>
					Cross my heart and hope to rye,<br>
					Stick a needle in my rye.<br>

					A few times I've been around the rack, and I am most certainly a Challah back girl. Definitely a Challah back girl. Not Jewish, but I'm a Challah back girl.
